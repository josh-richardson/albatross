### Albatross

A decentralized app store. Written in React, and built to run on the Arweave permaweb with no external dependencies. 

Deployed at: https://albatross.link

As of 23:59 EDT, current functionality exists here: https://arweave.net/MLMsOrBlWC6H-VKJfeMBPhh9y0Nie3L1UZuonpWPMns (however it's very much incomplete)

Future versions will be deployed below, although technically not elligible to compete in the hackathon :(
